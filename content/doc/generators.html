A content generator is a php class derived from TBaseGenerator which is included at runtime when necessary. The mechanism of the content generator is implemented by overriding the render(...) function of the ancestor class.

	&lt;?php

	class TFooGenerator extends TBaseGenerator
	{
		//  the render functions receives the node attributes and the inner text of the node as arguments
		//  to process them as it sees fit
		function render($attr = null, $innerText = null)
		{
			//  either return a string containing the content
			return '&lt;span&gt;foo was here&lt;/span&gt;';
			
			//  or you can simply echo it 
			echo '&lt;span&gt;foo was here&lt;/span&gt;';

			//  but don't do both, the framework will look at the function result first and 
			//  will ignore the echoed text if the result is not empty
		}
	}
